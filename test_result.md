# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

Starting with root cause analysis of common backend data handling errors affecting multiple systems."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

API endpoint /api/emergency-services responds with 200 status and proper location data (Bangalore coordinates processed correctly), but returns empty hospital arrays. The system appears to be falling back to static/demo data instead of fetching real hospitals from OpenStreetMap API. Location processing works (latitude: 12.9716, longitude: 77.5946 → Bangalore, Karnataka), but no actual hospital data is being returned. This indicates the OpenStreetMap integration may not be fully functional or the API calls are failing silently."

Add friends to see their activities.', (3) /api/friends/timeline - Returns combined timeline with friend activities (timeline array, friends_count), (4) /api/social/timeline - Returns social timeline with 15 public activities including user achievements with proper structure (id, type, user_name, title, description, timestamp, icon, points), (5) /api/engagement/timeline - Returns engagement-focused timeline with 7 events including level progression and XP tracking, (6) /api/engagement/friend-activities - Returns friend activities for engagement dashboard with proper empty state and suggested actions. All endpoints: ✅ Return 200 status with valid JWT token, ✅ Handle pagination parameters (limit, offset), ✅ Return proper JSON with activities/events/timeline arrays, ✅ Handle empty data gracefully with appropriate messages, ✅ Require proper authentication (return 403 without token), ✅ Have proper data structure with required fields (id, type, title, timestamp). Authentication working correctly - all endpoints properly reject requests without JWT tokens. Ready for frontend integration!"

All competitions show realistic prize pools and proper data structure. (2) 🏅 PRIZE CHALLENGES - ✅ Working with 4 challenges: 'Flash Savings Sprint', 'Campus Innovation Challenge', 'Streak Superstar', 'Monthly Budget Master'. All challenges properly structured and accessible. (3) 🏛️ CAMPUS REPUTATION - ⚠️ Endpoint working but returning empty campus_leaderboard array, indicating campus reputation data may need additional population or the test user's university ('Test University') is not in the main leaderboard. (4) 🎯 VIRAL MILESTONES - ✅ Working perfectly with live community savings data showing ₹16,226,650 total savings across all users. Three major milestones achieved: ₹10 lakh milestone (✅ achieved), ₹50 lakh milestone (✅ achieved), ₹1 crore milestone (✅ achieved). All milestone data is live and reflects real user activity. SUMMARY: Campus and viral features successfully converted from demo to live data. The database population with 801 users, 13,041 transactions, and competition data is working correctly. Only campus reputation leaderboard needs additional data population for full functionality."
